# CeylonCrafts-Website
A business website for a small scale Sri Lankan traditional mask crafting business


Description -: 

This a simple website for a small scale business in Sri Lanka where their main product is traditional wood craved masks. Here I used simple HTML, CSS, Javascript with Bootstrap 5 frameworks to make the website more responsive. User can see several pages from products to contacting and more information about the business. In the contact page, users also can submit a form to be contacted by the business.
